## 🚀 Project Overview

The Smart Logistics Decision System aims to optimize delivery operations using data-driven decision making. The system integrates operational data, environmental factors, and predictive modeling to improve route efficiency, delivery time estimation, and cost optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives
  
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Develop predictive models for delivery time and demand  
- Design decision algorithms for route and resource optimization  

## 📊 Dataset

**Base Dataset:**  
Smart Logistics Supply Chain Dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/smart-logistics-supply-chain-dataset

The original dataset contains shipment details, delivery timelines, geographic information, and operational attributes.

### Feature Engineering

A precipitation factor was added to the dataset using quantile-based binning to simulate weather impact on logistics performance. This allows the system to incorporate environmental conditions into delivery time and decision modeling.

## 🧠 Current Progress

- Repository initialized  
- Base dataset structured  
- Precipitation feature engineered using quantile binning  
- README documentation created
