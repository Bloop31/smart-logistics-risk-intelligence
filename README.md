## 🚀 Project Overview

The Smart Logistics Decision System aims to optimize delivery operations using data-driven decision making. The system integrates operational data, environmental factors, and predictive modeling to improve route efficiency, delivery time estimation, and cost optimization.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### 1️⃣ Risk-Based Delay Prediction
- Build a machine learning model that predicts delivery delay probability.
- Interpret model output probability as a structured **risk score**.

### 2️⃣ Risk Tier Classification
Convert predicted delay probability into operational risk levels:

| Probability Range | Risk Level |
|-------------------|------------|
| < 0.40            | Low Risk   |
| 0.40 – 0.70       | Medium Risk|
| > 0.70            | High Risk  |
| > 0.85            | Critical Risk |

### 3️⃣ Rule-Based Risk Overrides
Enhance ML predictions with domain-driven business logic:

- **Weather-Traffic Critical Rule:**  
  If Precipitation > 20mm AND Traffic = Heavy → Risk = Critical

- **Asset Stress Rule:**  
  If Asset_Utilization > 90% → Operational Risk = High

### 4️⃣ Risk-Driven Decision Engine
Attach automated actions based on risk level:

- 🟢 Low Risk → Normal delivery  
- 🟡 Medium Risk → Monitoring + slight route optimization  
- 🔴 High Risk → Re-route vehicle + notify operations  
- ⚫ Critical Risk → Immediate rerouting + AI-generated client notification + fleet redistribution  

### 5️⃣ Simulated Optimization Logic
- Simulate route optimization by adjusting estimated delivery time.
- Simulate fleet redistribution when asset utilization exceeds safe thresholds.

### 6️⃣ AI Communication Layer
Automatically generate customer notifications when risk is High or Critical.


## 📊 Dataset

**Base Dataset:**  
Smart Logistics Supply Chain Dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/smart-logistics-supply-chain-dataset

The original dataset contains shipment details, delivery timelines, geographic information, and operational attributes.

### Feature Engineering

A precipitation factor was added to the dataset using quantile-based binning to simulate weather impact on logistics performance. This allows the system to incorporate environmental conditions into delivery time and decision modeling.

## ⚖️ Phase 3 – Risk Classification & Decision Layer

### 🎯 Objective
Transform predicted delay probabilities into structured operational risk levels and integrate business rule overrides to create a robust decision engine.

---

### 🔄 Architecture Overview

Phase 3 converts:

Model Output → Risk Tier → Rule Overrides → Final Risk Level

Pipeline:

1. `delay_probability` (from Phase 2 model)
2. Probability-to-risk mapping
3. Rule-based escalation
4. Final operational risk classification

This creates a hybrid ML + domain-intelligence system.

---

### 📊 Step 3.1 – Probability → Risk Mapping

Delay probability is converted into structured risk tiers:

- `< 0.40` → Low  
- `0.40 – 0.70` → Medium  
- `> 0.70` → High  
- `> 0.85` → Critical  

Implemented via:

`get_risk_level(probability)`

Generated column:

`ml_risk_level`

This ensures model output becomes actionable.

---

### 🏢 Step 3.2 – Rule-Based Risk Overrides

To enhance robustness, business logic rules were introduced.

#### Rule 1 – Weather-Traffic Escalation
If:
- Precipitation (mm) > 20  
- Traffic_Status_Heavy == 1  

→ Risk escalated to **Critical**

#### Rule 2 – Asset Stress Escalation
If:
- Asset_Utilization > 90  

→ Risk escalated to **High**

Final risk level is determined as the maximum severity between:

- ML-derived risk  
- Rule-based escalation  

Generated column:

`final_risk_level`

---

### 🧠 Why Combine ML + Rule Logic?

Pure ML models may miss rare but operationally dangerous scenarios.

By integrating domain rules:

- Critical weather conditions are never ignored  
- Fleet stress is proactively managed  
- Operational safety is prioritized  
- Decision robustness increases  

This design reflects real-world logistics intelligence systems.

---

### 📈 Output

Generated:

`data/processed/dataset_with_risk_levels.csv`

Risk distribution example:

- Medium ≈ 32%  
- High ≈ 24%  
- Critical ≈ 24%  
- Low ≈ 19%  

Phase 3 completes the structured risk engine of the Smart Logistics Decision System.
